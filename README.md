# IMDb-Analysis
The provided Python script is a sentiment analysis tool designed for the IMDb movie review dataset. Leveraging natural language processing techniques, the script employs a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a given movie review is positive or negative based on its textual content. The script first loads and preprocesses the IMDb dataset, tokenizing and stemming the text while removing stopwords. It then utilizes the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer to convert the text data into numerical features. After splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, the model is trained on the former and evaluated on the latter. The script prints the accuracy and classification reports for both the validation and test sets, providing insights into the model's performance in sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The goal is to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data and to provide a snapshot of its effectiveness in determining the sentiment expressed in movie reviews.
